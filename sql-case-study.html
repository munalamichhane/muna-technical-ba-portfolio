      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project demonstrates how SQL-driven analysis can support business decision-making. 
        The focus is on analyzing operational and marketing-related datasets to identify trends, 
        define KPIs, and translate analytical findings into actionable insights for stakeholders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Emphasis is on business questions, analytical reasoning, and communication of insights, rather than just writing queries.
      </p>

      <h2>Business Context</h2>
      <p>
        Organizations often collect large volumes of operational and campaign data but struggle to extract meaningful insights aligned with business objectives. 
        Stakeholders need clear answers to questions such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Which campaigns or activities are performing well?</li>
        <li>Where are resources being underutilized?</li>
        <li>What trends indicate potential risks or opportunities?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This project simulates a real-world scenario where a Technical Business Analyst uses SQL to analyze data and support data-driven decisions.
      </p>

      <h2>Stakeholders</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Business stakeholders (marketing or operations managers)</li>

        <li>Technical teams (data engineers or developers maintaining the database)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Technical Business Analyst acts as a bridge between raw data and stakeholder understanding.

      <h2>Dataset Description</h2>
      <p>
        The dataset represents operational or marketing activity data and includes fields such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Campaign or activity identifiers</li>

      <h2>Key Business Questions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Which campaigns or activities show the highest performance over time?</li>
        <li>How do performance metrics vary by category or channel?</li>

        <li>Which areas underperform relative to business expectations?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Analytical Approach</h2>
      <h3>1. KPI Definition</h3>
      <p>
        Key performance indicators were defined in collaboration with assumed stakeholder goals, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Total activity volume</li>
        <li>Conversion or success rate</li>
        <li>Performance trends over time</li>
        <li>Comparative performance across categories</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. SQL Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        SQL queries were written to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Filter and clean relevant records</li>
        <li>Aggregate metrics using GROUP BY</li>
        <li>Identify trends using time-based analysis</li>
        <li>Compare performance across categories or segments</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Example techniques used:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY</li>
        <li>Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG)</li>
        <li>Date-based filtering and grouping</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Focus was on clarity and correctness, ensuring results were interpretable by non-technical stakeholders.
      </p>
